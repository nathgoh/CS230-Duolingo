# CS230: Duolingo SLAM Shared Task
Developed a deep learning model predict studentsâ€™ learning performance based on their past learning data. 

Baseline model and evaluation script is provided from the archive for Duolingo's 2018 Shared Task on Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM). The model is L2-regularized logistic regression, trained with SGD weighted by frequency.   

## Setup - Baseline

This baseline model is written in Python. It depends on the `future` library for compatibility with both Python 2 and 3,
which on many machines may be obtained by executing `pip install future` in a console.

In order to run the any model and evaluate your predictions, perform the following:

* Download and extract the contents of the file to a local directory.
* To train for example, the baseline model: 
  * Open a console and `cd` into the directory where `baseline.py` is stored
  * Execute: 
    
    ```bash
    python baseline.py --train path/to/train/data.train 
                       --test path/to/dev_or_test/data.dev
                       --pred path/to/dump/predictions.pred
    ``` 
    to create predictions for your chosen track. Note that we use `test` interchangeably for the dev and test sets because both are test sets.
* To evaluate the baseline model:
  * Execute     
  
    ```bash
    python eval.py --pred path/to/your/predictions.pred
                   --key path/to/dev_or_test/labels.dev.key
    ```
    to print a variety of metrics for the baseline predictions to the screen.

## Setup - LSTM Model

This LSTM model is written in Python. To run it, First run the `get_data.ipynb` and change the file destination for train, test, and key in `get_raw_dataset` for your chosen track. Similarly, change the save pickle file destination that is at the end of the notebook.

Begin training the model by running the `build_model.ipynb`.
